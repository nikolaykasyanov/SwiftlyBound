# SwiftlyBound

It's a small experiment that I conducted to get an idea how to do MVVM in Swift.
It's very simple and doesn't even support value transformations yet.

It's inspired by [MFBBinding](https://github.com/flix-tech/MFBBinding).

At the moment SwiftlyBound can only be installed via Carthage:

```
github "nikolaykasyanov/SwiftlyBound"
```
